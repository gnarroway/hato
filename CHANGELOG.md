## [0.7.2]
### Fixed

## [0.7.1]

## [0.6.0]
### Added
- More flexibility in multipart file types (#13 thanks @vincentjames501)
- Alpha support for converting response body based on content-type with `:as :auto`

### Changed
- Use cheshire `parse-stream-strict` to decode InputStream directly. (Requires cheshire 5.9.0 or later)
- Always parse JSON non-lazily to prevent stream being closed prematurely. 
See [clj-http#489](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/issues/489) for similar discussion.
- Simplify code by always using InputStream BodyHandler in `client.clj`, so coercion handling is pure middleware.
